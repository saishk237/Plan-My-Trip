# Design Guidelines: AI Travel Itinerary Generator

## Design Approach

**Reference-Based: Travel Industry Leaders**
Drawing primary inspiration from Airbnb's clean, aspirational aesthetic combined with Booking.com's functional clarity and Linear's modern form design. This creates an experience that feels both emotionally engaging (travel is aspirational) and highly functional (trip planning requires clarity).

**Core Principles:**
- Aspirational yet accessible: Evoke wanderlust while maintaining usability
- Progressive disclosure: Guide users through the planning journey step-by-step
- Scannable results: Make itineraries easy to read and digest
- Trust and credibility: Professional polish that inspires confidence in AI recommendations
